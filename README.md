# DissertationProject
##What was my dissertation?
My dissertation was based on pathfinding for a group of AI (agents), without using flocking. My dissertation was split between the project, collecting the data and then putting that data into graphs.

##What data did I collect?
I collected the average FPS (Frames per Second) and the time it took for all agents to finish the maze.

##Explanation of the layout
The Project consists of the Unity project and videos that pertain to the project. The videos show a visual perspective of some of the results.
